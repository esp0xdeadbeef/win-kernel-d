# Introduction to Process Handles

In this presentation, we will explore the concept of process handles, an essential asset of processes.

## Overview of Process Assets
We have previously discussed two main types of assets:
1. **Address Space**: The most crucial asset, representing the memory space available to the process.
2. **Binaries**: These are loaded into the header space and dictate the operations a process can perform.

## What is a Handle?

### Definition and Function
- **Handles**: Unlike direct memory addresses, handles are identifiers provided by the kernel that reference data structures within the kernel space.
- **Purpose**: They are used for accessing protected resources like files, network connections, or devices.

### Analogy
Consider visiting a retail shop where you can see items but cannot directly access them. Here, the shopkeeper (kernel) checks if you have the right to access an item (resource) based on your privileges before granting access.

### Technical Insight
- **Handles in Windows**: Typically represented as numbers, these are obtained via Windows API calls such as `CreateFile`.
- **Kernel Interaction**: Handles allow user-mode programs indirect access to kernel data structures.

## Types of Handles
- **Files**: To access any file from user mode, you need a handle.
- **Threads and Processes**: Each has a unique handle that refers to kernel objects like the EProcess block.
- **Synchronization Objects**: Mutexes, semaphores, and IO completion ports are all accessed via handles.

## How to Obtain and Use Handles
1. **Creation**: Handles are typically created through specific API calls (e.g., `CreateFile` for files or `CreateProcess` for processes).
2. **Usage**: Handles can be used to perform operations on the resource they reference.
3. **Closure**: After use, handles should be closed to free up system resources.

## Demonstration: Using Process Explorer
- **Viewing Handles**: In Process Explorer, handles can be viewed by selecting a process and navigating to the lower pane view (`CTRL+H`).
- **Types of Handles Observed**:
  - File handles point to file objects in the kernel.
  - Registry keys, session objects, and threads are also visible through their respective handles.

## Summary
Handles are crucial for accessing system resources securely from user mode. They represent kernel structures and are vital for system interaction.
