# Exploring Process Address Space

In this presentation, we will discuss the concept of address space as a crucial asset of any process.

## What is Address Space?

Address space represents the potential memory accessible by a process. It's important to understand:
- **Theoretical Size**: In a 32-bit system, the address space is 4GB, which is 2^32 bytes.
- **Memory Isolation**: Ensures that programs run independently without interfering with each other's memory.

### Memory Allocation and Management

- **User and Kernel Space**: The first 2GB is normally user space, and the second 2GB is kernel space, though configurations may vary (e.g., Linux or Windows in different modes).
- **Memory Pages**: The address space is divided into pages, commonly 4KB in size, but can be larger depending on the operating system settings.

## Demonstrations and Tools

### Memory Allocation Functions:
- Fundamental functions like `VirtualAlloc` internally call system-specific functions to manage memory within the address space.
- Every process, such as Notepad, Word, or Excel, typically has 4GB of address space in a 32-bit system.

### Debugging and Analysis:
- **Using a Debugger**: Allows detailed inspection of the address space to read and write memory.
- **Sysinternals VMMap**: A tool for visualizing the use of address space, particularly useful for examining user-mode spaces.
- **Kernel Debugger (KD)**: Best suited for inspecting the kernel space of any process.

## Practical Example:
- **Process Inspection**: We will attach a debugger to a running process, such as Visual Studio, to observe memory allocation and access patterns.
- **Memory Analysis**: Using commands like `!address -summary`, we will inspect allocated and free memory regions within the process's address space.

## Summary

This session covered the basics of process address space, including how memory is allocated and managed within a process. The tools and methods discussed provide a foundation for deeper exploration in future sessions.
