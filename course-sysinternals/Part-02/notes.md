## Introduction 

In this presentation, we will explore how Windows supports multitasking through process management. Multitasking, at its core, is about allowing multiple tasks to run concurrently without interfering with each other.

## Multitasking 

Think of multitasking in Windows as managing several households in a neighborhood. Each task, like each household, operates independently. They are isolated to ensure they don't inadvertently affect each other, much like houses provide privacy and personal space.

### Why Different Processes? 

Processes in Windows are akin to individual homes in a neighborhood. They are separate for several key reasons:
 
- **Privacy:**  Each process maintains its own data, hidden from others.
 
- **Space:**  They prevent tasks from clashing, ensuring smooth operation.
 
- **Non-interference:**  Each process runs its own set of instructions without disrupting others.

### What is a Process? 

Imagine a process as a house with a defined boundary, known as the virtual address space. This boundary separates one process's operations from another, analogous to how a house's walls separate one family's living space from another.

## Memory 

Memory in this context is the theoretical space a program can utilize, not tied directly to the physical RAM or storage. It's like the blueprint of a house, outlining the maximum space available, though not all is used at once.

## Threads 

Threads are the individual activities happening within a house. Just as family members perform tasks like cooking or watching TV, threads handle specific operations within a process.

### Handles 

Handles are akin to keys. Just as keys allow you to access your car, handles are necessary for accessing various system resources like files and network connections.

### Security Tokens 

Security tokens determine what a process can and cannot do, similar to how a resident's status (e.g., homeowner vs. renter) can define their privileges within a community.

### Memory Allocation 

Memory allocation can be thought of as different rooms within a house, such as the living room (stack), basement (heap), and attic (reserved memory), each serving specific purposes.

### Creating a Process 
Creating a process is like building a new house. For instance, launching `notepad.exe` by double-clicking its icon is like a contractor (Explorer) initiating the construction of a house.
When a process is terminated, it's comparable to demolishing a house, either done neatly by its inhabitants or abruptly by external forces.

### Demo: Task Manager and Process Explorer 

**Task Manager:**  

- Access it by right-clicking the taskbar and selecting "Task Manager" or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+Esc`.

- Use it to view all running processes by selecting "Show processes from all users" and customize the display via the "View" menu.

**Process Explorer:** 

- This tool offers a detailed view of process hierarchies and resource usage, helping you understand the relationships and activities within each "household."

## Terms to avoid: 

Clearification are needed if any of these terms are used:
 
- **Task:**  A general term; needs specific context in Windows.
 
- **Application:**  Broadly used; can refer to components like browser plugins.
 
- **Program:**  Can indicate a single process or a collection of processes, depending on context.

## Summary 

Processes define the boundaries of task execution in Windows, ensuring that each task runs independently and securely. This structure is essential for effective multitasking, a feature common across various operating systems.
