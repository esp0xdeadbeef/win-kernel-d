# Exploring Environmental Variables and Command-Line Arguments

In this presentation, we'll delve into environmental variables and command-line arguments, fundamental aspects of inter-process communication and program configuration.

## Overview

Environmental variables and command-line arguments are among the oldest mechanisms for inter-process communication. They are widely used in programming languages like C, C#, and Java to pass information into programs at runtime.

### Command-Line Arguments
- **Storage in Windows**: In Windows, command-line arguments are stored in the Process Environment Block (PEB) data structure within user mode.
- **Usage**: They specify how a program should run or which specific tasks and parameters to execute.

### Environmental Variables
- **Purpose**: Serve as dynamic-named values that affect the way running processes will behave on a computer.
- **Storage**: Also stored in the PEB, similar to command-line arguments.

## Main Function Signature in C

The signature for the main function in C typically includes three parameters:
1. `int argc` - Number of command-line arguments
2. `char *argv[]` - Array of command-line arguments
3. `char *envp[]` - Array of environmental variables

These parameters allow a C program to receive and utilize user inputs and system environment settings.

## Demonstrations

### Viewing Command-Line Arguments and Environmental Variables

#### Using Process Explorer:
- **Selection of Process**: For example, selecting the `LogonUI.exe` process in Process Explorer.
- **Viewing Data**: Inspecting the command-line arguments and environmental variables of the selected process to understand how they are configured.

### Debugger Attachment
- **Process Selection**: Attaching a debugger to Process Explorer to view real-time command-line and environmental variable usage within a process.

## Summary

Command-line arguments and environmental variables are crucial for defining the execution context of processes. They are set at the time of process creation by the `CreateProcess` API and stored within the PEB of the user mode.
