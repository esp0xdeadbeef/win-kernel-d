# Understanding GDI and User Object Handles in Processes

In this presentation, we'll explore another type of handle within Windows operating systems—GDI and user object handles—delving into their unique characteristics and functions.

## Introduction to GDI and User Object Handles

GDI (Graphics Device Interface) and user object handles are similar to the general handles we've discussed previously but have specific roles related to display and user interaction elements within a Windows environment.

### Key Differences:
- **Purpose**: These handles are used to manage display-related artifacts, like windows and graphics, which are crucial for user interface operations.
- **Management**: The kernel treats GDI and user object handles differently from other types of handles. They are primarily managed by the `win32k.sys` driver, and the core kernel (`ntoskrnl.exe`) plays only a minimal role.

## Types of GDI and User Object Handles

- **GDI Objects**: These are used for drawing and rendering tasks, such as painting bitmaps or lines. Examples include pens, brushes, and device contexts.
- **User Objects**: These are related to the Windows user interface elements, such as windows, menus, and cursors.

### Creation and Management:
- **APIs**: Functions like `CreateWindow` generate these objects, providing ready-made elements with basic functionalities.
- **Desktop and Kernel Objects**: GDI and user objects interact within the desktop context, existing within a user session's virtual memory space.

## Demonstrations: Viewing GDI and User Objects

### Using Task Manager and Process Explorer:
- **Task Manager**: You can add columns to display the number of GDI and user objects used by each process. This is useful for understanding the resource utilization of graphical and UI elements.
- **Process Explorer**: Similar capabilities as Task Manager but provides more detailed insights into the handle usage of processes.

## Advanced Topics: Desktops and Windows Stations

- **Session and Desktop Isolation**: Sessions in Windows can be thought of as separate display environments, akin to having multiple virtual computers. Each session can contain multiple desktops, which host the user interfaces.
- **Object Sharing**: Most user objects cannot be shared across desktops, reinforcing session isolation.

## Summary: The Role of GDI and User Object Handles

We've explored how GDI and user object handles function within the Windows environment, highlighting their importance in managing graphical and user interface components. These handles allow processes to interact effectively with the system's graphical and desktop management features.

## Conclusion

This presentation delved into the specifics of GDI and user object handles, crucial for developers working with graphical or user interface elements in Windows. For further information, detailed discussions on these topics will be covered in upcoming sessions on Windows display internals and WDDM.

Thank you for attending, and we look forward to further exploring these concepts in future presentations!
