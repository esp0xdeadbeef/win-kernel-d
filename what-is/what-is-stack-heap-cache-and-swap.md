### 1. The Stack 

The stack operates like a stack of plates where you can only add or remove plates from the top. In computing, the stack is used to keep track of active functions and local variables in a program. When a function is called, it is added to the stack. Once the function execution is complete, it is removed from the stack.

**Key Points:** 

- Manages function calls and local variables.

- Grows and shrinks automatically with function calls and returns.

- Offers fast access due to its organized structure. (A-Tier speed)

### 2. The Heap 

The heap resembles a toy box where items can be added or removed from any location. It is used for dynamic memory allocation, allowing the program to store data that needs to persist beyond the execution of the function that created it.

**Key Points:** 

- Facilitates dynamic memory allocation.

- Adjusts in size as memory is allocated and freed.

- Access speed is slower compared to the stack due to its less organized nature. (B-Tier speed)

### 3. The Cache 

The cache acts like a handy notebook for quick reference. It is a small, extremely fast memory area that stores copies of frequently accessed data, enabling quicker data retrieval compared to accessing it from the slower main memory.

**Key Points:** 

- Speeds up access to frequently used data.

- Very fast but limited in size. (S-Tier speed)

- Managed automatically by the hardware.

### 4. The Swap Space 

Swap space functions like a storage closet for overflow items. It is a portion of the hard drive used by the operating system to temporarily store data that cannot fit into the main memory (RAM). While slower than RAM, it helps maintain system performance when memory is low.

**Key Points:** 

- Extends RAM capacity by providing additional storage space.

- Slower than RAM as it utilizes the hard drive. (C-Tier speed)

- Automatically managed by the operating system.
