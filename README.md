# Research Questions answered:

1. What is the relationship between the Windows operating system and the ISA-88 standard, and how is it implemented in industrial settings?

The ISA-88 standard, primarily designed for batch control, is not directly applicable to continuous processes such as those managed by the Windows operating system in industrial settings. I was aware of this limitation before starting this research. However, there are similarities, which I have explained in detail in [S88 structure](S88-structure-improvised-win-kernel.md).

To make a comprehensive comparison, it is essential to consider the ISA-88 (Batch Control) standard alongside other related standards:
 
- [ISA-106 (Procedure Automation for Continuous Process Operations)](https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-standards-committees/isa106)
 
- [ISA-99 (Industrial Automation and Control Systems Security)](https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-standards-committees/isa99)
 
- [ISA-18 (Instrument Signals and Alarms)](https://www.isa.org/standards-and-publications/isa-standards/isa-standards-committees/isa18)

Combining these standards provides a more complete framework for comparison and implementation in industrial environments.
